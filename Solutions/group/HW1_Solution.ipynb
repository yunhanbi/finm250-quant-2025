    "There are thousands of individual risky assets in which HMC can invest.  Explain why MV optimization across 1,000 securities is infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Determinant of cov matrix need to not be zero to find the inverse, thus, the inverse of the covariance matrix can and will be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistically speaking, the inversion of the covariance is not feasible. The inversion of the cov matrix (according to mathematician is invertible as long as the determinants are not zero). Statistically there will be a lot of noise in the covariance matrix, and thus the inversion will not be feasible. A tiny determinant will explode any level of uncertainty in the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is noise in the data, the optimization will take any noise seriously (financial data is incredibly noisey.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.\n",
    "Rather than optimize across all securities directly, HMC runs a two-stage optimization.\n",
    "1. They build asset class portfolios with each one optimized over the securities of the specific asset class.  \n",
    "2. HMC combines the asset-class portfolios into one total optimized portfolio.\n",

    "### 3.\n",
    "Should TIPS form a new asset class or be grouped into one of the other 11 classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "You need to look at the cross correlations with the other asset classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. \n",
    "Why does HMC focus on real returns when analyzing its portfolio allocation? Is this just a matter of scaling, or does using real returns versus nominal returns potentially change the MV solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Does any large asset manager want to make sure they are getting high nominal or high real returns? You may think inflation will dig into either.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is rather case by case. If inflation is high, TIPS will perform well. If inflation is lower, regular bonds will outperform. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question is your objective. If it is nominal or post-inflation adjusted return.\n",

    "Exhibits 5 shows zero allocation to domestic equities and domestic bonds across the entire computed range of targeted returns, (5.75% to 7.25%). Conceptually, why is the constraint binding in all these cases? What would the unconstrained portfolio want to do with those allocations and why?\n",

This ranking makes sense due to the fact that TIPS provide a practically risk free return and therefore should be on the lower end of volatilities.\n",

Lastly, TIPS provide a sharpe ratio of 0.401091 while IEF and BWX have sharpe ratios of 0.258569 and 0.093202 respectively. Therefore, in terms of pure returns, volatility, and sharpe ratios, TIPS outperform domestic and foreign debt (IEF and BWX respectively.)"

Therefore, with adjusted TIPS in the portfolio, the IOS is slightly smaller. It is also important to note that the tangency portfolio with the adjusted TIPS yields a dramatically lower annualized mean return (40.4335%  instead of 115.145%) and a lower vol (22.5329% instead of 100.328%).\n",

    "Therefore, based on the above data analysis it is not clear whether or not TIPS truly expands or tighten the IOS. The presence of TIPS in the original portfolio does lead to a slightly higher Sharpe and TIPS removal did lead to a significantly lower vol and higher return. This could mean that they may be the source of the volatility in the portfolio. Additionally, when their expected return was artificially increased, the portfolio's performance worsened. Thus, it is not clear that TIPS expands the IOS in a beneficial way for Harvard. More analysis on correlation would provide more detailed information on whether or not to include the TIPS. We can assume that TIPS likely have a higher variance inflation factor with IEF (The 7-10 Year Treasury bond ETF) since TIPS are simply the inflation adjusted versions of such bonds. In fact, the correlation between IEF and TIP is 0.754102 which is quite high. The fact that TIPS are highly correlated with will conflate the covariances of the returns of the portfolio and reduce diversification benefits which would support the exclusion of TIPS from Harvard's portfolio as a separate asset."
